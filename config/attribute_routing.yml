# =============================================================================
# SIMPLIFIED ATTRIBUTE ROUTING CONFIGURATION  
# =============================================================================
# Clean and lightweight configuration for attribute extraction routing.
# Each attribute maps to exactly one service with optional image filtering.

# Attribute to service mapping with image type filtering
attributes:
  # Heuristics service - color extraction works better on close-up images
  color: 
    service: heuristics
    image_filter: non_close_up  # Only use close-up images for color extraction
  
  # Fashion-CLIP service - category classification uses all images
  category: 
    service: fashion-clip
    image_filter: non_close_up  # Use all images for category classification
  
  # LLM service - condition assessment benefits from multiple viewpoints
  condition: 
    service: llm-multimodal
    image_filter: all  # Use all images for condition assessment
  
  # Microsoft Florence service - brand OCR works better on close-up images
  brand: 
    service: microsoft-florence
    image_filter: close_up  # Only use close-up images for brand extraction

# Optional service timeouts (seconds)
timeouts:
  default: 30
  llm-multimodal: 45
  microsoft-florence: 90  # Brand extraction needs more time for OCR processing with multiple images
  heuristics: 90  # Color extraction depends on microsoft-florence for image processing
